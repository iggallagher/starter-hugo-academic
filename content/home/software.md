I have written a Python package for graph spectral embedding available at the GitHub repository, [Spectral-Embedding](https://github.com/iggallagher/Spectral-Embedding).

The package includes a variety of tools for spectral embedding of graphs, using the theory of the generalised random dot product graph and its many extensions to analyse networks.
